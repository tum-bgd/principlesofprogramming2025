    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (**Num**erical **Py**thon) is an open source Python library that’s widely used in science and engineering[^1]. For example, you can use it for working with vectors, matrices, linear algebra, optimization and much more. This course gives an overview, but it is intended to be extended by readers with online ressources for an in-depth understanding.\n",

    "### Course Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This course requires a working Jupyter environment to actively execute the code blocks and solve small programming task and exercises. Basic understanding of Python and its syntax is practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is presented as a set of Jupyter notebooks that includes some exercised and taks for self learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After this course you should have learned and be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- run and edit a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- be familiar with NumPy concepts and syntax\n",
    "- solve computational science problems in NumPy\n",
    "- understand how to work with images in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1: Data model, ndarray creation and manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2: Indexing, slicing, broadcasting and views\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3: Statistics and linear algebra routines\n",
