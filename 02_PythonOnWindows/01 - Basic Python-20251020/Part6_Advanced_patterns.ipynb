    "### Coroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines are a feature in Python that allows you to write asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way. A couroutine can be suspended and resumed from the paused point for multiple times before the final termination. In this way, when multiple couroutines working together, they will be executed in an asynchronous manner and seemingly behave like concurrence. However, they are actually not, because Python's global interpreter lock (GIL) prevents multiple threads. Python's GIL will likely to be removed in the future, but this does not detract from the elegant nature of coroutines. Consider the following example"

    "There are two asynchronized function `Count()` and `Hello()` working together. From the output, they are seemingly executing simultaneously. When the program runs to `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, this function will be suspended, and other suspended functions will resume. That's why the outputs of these two functions are alternating. In modern Python (3.4+), we use the `async` keyword to define a coroutine (asynchronized function), and the `await` keyword for denoting the pause/resume point."

    "Coroutines usually work with *generators* behaving like producers in Python. In the context of coroutines, generators can be leveraged as asynchronous generators, combining the benefits of both concepts. Asynchronous generators use the `yield` keyword within an asynchronous function to produce a sequence of values asynchronously, making them particularly useful for scenarios like fetching data from external sources, handling asynchronous I/O operations, and managing concurrent tasks. Then another coroutine(s) will consume the generated data and process them. Together, generators and coroutines provide a versatile and elegant approach to working with both synchronous and asynchronous data streams in Python. Below is an example."
