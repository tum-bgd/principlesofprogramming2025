    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is intended to give introduction to the Python programming language. It focusses on giving a bief overview of basic language concept to enable the adience to use it to solve computational tasks and problems. It is not considered a comprehensive coverage of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This course requires a working Jupyter environment to actively execute the code blocks and solve small programming task and exercises.\n",

    "### Course Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is presented as a set of Jupyter notebooks that includes some exercised and taks for self learning.\n",

    "- write and execute mathematical expressions\n",
    "- handle conditional code execution\n",
    "- apply control flow with loops\n",
    "- know collection data types and how to use them\n",
    "- understand how to use functions to structure your program\n",
